🧠 There are 3 core pillars in scaling a startup.

🗣️ Lead Generation – Getting Leads! 

💸 Sales – Turning Leads Into Customers!

✅ Fulfillment – Delivering on Your Promise!

But before you can sell or fulfill, you need LEADS.

As Alex Hormozi explains in his book #100MLeads,

There are 4 methods to generate them:

1️⃣ Cold Outreach – Connecting w/ Strangers

2️⃣ Warm Outreach – Connecting w/ Ppl You Know

3️⃣ Social Media – Content for your Target Buyers

4️⃣ Paid Ads – Ads to Reach & Retarget Leads

Mastering these methods fuels your sales engine.

Without them, your pipeline runs dry.

And you can’t scale the business.

Attending conferences can be overwhelming - but they don’t have to be.

🧠 Here’s how to break the ice and turn those handshakes into opportunities.

1. The Handshake Agreement
- If you’re at a conference, you’ve already agreed to network, whether you realize it or not.
- It’s like the first day of college: everyone’s out of their comfort zone. Be the one to start the conversation, and you’ll be remembered.

2. The 24-Hour Rule
- Conferences move fast. If you don’t follow up within 24 hours, you risk being forgotten.
- Strike while the conversation is fresh - send a DM, connect on LinkedIn, or a voice note to stay top of mind.

3. Stand Out from the Crowd
- Instead of sending a boring email afterwards, get creative with your follow-up. My trick is to record a personalized video. It takes seconds but makes a lasting impression.

CoEfficient Labs tested this approach at #AffiliateSummitWest - and the results speak for themselves.

🤔 How do you make meaningful connections at events?

🎥 Our 5-Step Event Content Playbook:

1️⃣David Courtemarche and I met hundreds of ppl at meetups 
2️⃣We snapped selfies, filmed b-roll, and made recaps
3️⃣Ethan Harm turned that footage into polished content
4️⃣We tagged everyone involved — including Affiliate Summit 
5️⃣Our new connections saw the content in their feed

This lead to more engagements > which triggered the LinkedIn algorithm to boost our post to other attendees of #ASW2025

🔑 The Result?

- Thousands of organic impressions
- 300 new leads (in our target persona)
- CoEfficient Labs stayed at the top-of-mind

At Affiliate Summit West, we walked out with 400+ new leads — and no, it wasn’t luck.

It started with a simple goal:

🎯 100 meaningful conversations each — broken down by day, and even by hour.

Instead of just ""seeing who we’d run into,"" we set a plan:

• 10 convos before lunch
• 10 convos before dinner
• 10 convos before bed

Big goals feel less overwhelming when you break them into small wins.

And that’s the key to making the most out of conferences.

Set your goal before you walk in — then reverse-engineer the path to hit it.

At LA Tech Week, we asked founders and VCs:

What’s the secret to building a successful company?

Their answers came down to one thing:

Know your customer.

Here’s what they said:

→ ""Understand their fears and address them head-on.""
→ ""Being transparent builds trust and drives revenue.""
→ ""Use empathy to truly understand their needs.""

It’s not just about knowing who they are today.

It’s about what their needs will be tomorrow.

And if you’re aiming to sell your company one day?

Start by solving the problems of your future buyers.

They die from sticking to good ones for too long.

The founders who win?

They’re the ones who spot a better path—and take it—before it’s obvious to everyone else.

That’s exactly what TX Zhuo (now Managing Partner at Fika Ventures) learned while building his first company.

🎯 When customers weren’t responding to support emails, his team swapped their real names for ones that sounded more “professional”—and their return rate dropped.

📦 When the team was personally packing 1,000+ books a night, they quickly realized it wasn’t scalable—and outsourced before it crushed their bandwidth.

The pivots weren’t always glamorous.

But they were fast.

And they kept the business alive.

This clip comes from our latest episode of Demo Day, where TX shares his lessons from building a $20M+ company and how those experiences shaped the way he backs founders today.

→ Meet great talent.

But what we didn’t expect?

The real value wasn’t just in the students…

It was in the other tables:
- Recruiters
- Sales leaders
- Executives

All from companies we could actually help.

So we did what we always do:
- Talked to everyone
- Got the emails
- Shared what makes us different

No fancy booth.

No hard sell.

Just authentic connection.

Because whether it’s a job fair, a lunch meeting, or a yoga studio (yep, met someone from YogaWorks)...

→ It’s all a stage if you treat it like one.

If you want new business, new intros, new growth—

You can’t wait for the “right moment.”

You need to make the moment.

Here’s Jeff Bocan's 3-step method for handling it 👇

1. Communicate early
- ""People fill the void — and usually not in your favor.”
- Silence creates doubt. Say it early.

2. Have a clear plan
- ""Even if you don’t know it’s right, lay out a plan.”
- Direction > Perfection.

3. Check in frequently
- ""I’ll follow up in two or three weeks…”
- Momentum comes from updates, not miracles.

And if you're stuck — ask for help.

Jeff reminds us: being open invites collaboration, not criticism.

And how you can avoid the same mistake 👇

When TX Zhuo (now Managing Partner at Fika Ventures) got the chance to sell his startup, he and his cofounder rehearsed every scenario.

They knew their number.

They made a plan.

They promised to walk if the offer came in low.

Then the moment came…

And they said “yes” anyway — 30% below what they agreed to.

They didn’t lose money because they didn’t know what they wanted.

They lost it because they didn’t prepare for the pressure in the room.

This isn’t just a funny story — it’s a gut check for every founder heading into their first negotiation:

👉 Know your walk-away number.

👉 Rehearse sticking to it.

👉 Don’t let the moment shake your mindset.

Start with yes.

Wear a smile.

Lead with positivity.

It sounds simple—but it changes everything.

Because business isn’t just a game of ideas, capital, or competition.

It’s a game of people.

And if people don’t enjoy being around you—

they won’t work with you.

They won’t hire you.

They won’t invest in you.

Founders who attract opportunity are smart, strategic, and most importantly…

They’re magnetic.

And that magnetism often comes down to one overlooked trait:

Being open, energized, and genuinely positive.

At CoEfficient Labs, we’re not waiting around for the perfect brief.

If there’s a brand we love — we build the opportunity.

No contract. No approval. No “go ahead.”

Just a team of scrappy creatives with a camera, a plan, and a whole lot of chickpea pasta. (LOL)

The way TBWA\Chiat\Day turned mascots into influencers is exactly the kind of thinking we try to bring to every UGC campaign we make at CoEfficient Labs.

They didn’t rely on celebrity cameos or one-off gimmicks.

They worked with what they had and made it unforgettable.

That’s a creative advantage most brands overlook.

At CoEfficient Labs, we work with actors instead of influencers for the same reasons:

→ More control
→ More scale
→ More brand consistency

It’s not about who is in the video.

It’s about how the story hits - and where it shows up.

Special shoutout to Bert Marissen for breaking down the campaign in this article:
👉 https://lnkd.in/gYKvYYCp

My key takeaways:

- Familiarity drives engagement - not fame
- Distribute before you debut
- Build a world - not just a spot

1 lunch with Kelly Perdew (Here’s why I did it👇🏻)

Many people asked why I couldn’t just have the meeting over zoom.  

And the answer is simple.

Getting out of the building is where the magic happens. 

Not tucked away behind your laptop.

Not sent from behind a tweet.

But face to face.

When we wrapped lunch — I gave Kelly a giant hug. 

He didn’t ask for it (😂) 

But damn it felt good to make it all the way here.

You can’t always control everything in your business — the tariffs, the AI, the economy — but you sure as hell can care the most.

You can get on that flight.

Book that hotel room.

Hop in that cab!

Jesse Itzler always talks about “make your own luck — and — “control the controllables”.

Well, I made my own luck.

I made it happen.

And now we have a memory for a lifetime.

At #LATechWeek, we asked founders and VCs:

What’s your #1 advice for new entrepreneurs?

Their answers all came back to one thing: networking.

Here’s what they shared:

→ ""Face-to-face connections build deeper relationships.""
→ ""Trust is the foundation of great partnerships.""
→ ""Networking opens doors you didn’t know existed.”

But networking can feel intimidating.

If you’re nervous or introverted, here’s a tip:

💡""Start with something personal.

A simple question, even about the event, can open doors.""

Networking isn’t just about contacts.

It’s about building a community.

So next time you’re at an event, remember:

Until now! 😄 (Day 1 @ #LATECHWEEK)

We kicked off at the LeadrPro event.

It was hosted at the M.i.'s Westside Comedy Theater (which I didn't even know existed -- it's in the alley behind the WeWork near the Promenade).

Chris S. was 🔥 (follow him!)

He had an entire slide presentation put together, and the night before, decided to change his approach on ""The Founders Journey"" and rather than going through his slides -- he told his life story.

Founders (like myself) love to learn through stories.

And it was clear that everyone felt his talk was authentic, ""no-bullshit"", and overally got them fired up to stick it out through the hard times.

We'll be releasing more footage from the event, but here's a quick video in case you weren't able to be there.

Special shout out to Mucker Capital for putting resources towards this eclectic space.  

I'm Sean Goldfaden.

And THIS is #LATechWeek.

Here’s 3 BIG Learnings for Me:

1️⃣ You can’t do good business with bad people.

• When clients, partners, or teammates are mean, lack integrity, are always looking for an edge or a way to pull your confidence down, or create unnecessary obstacles that hinder success….WALK AWAY.

2️⃣ Want money? Ask for advice.

• Seek wisdom and deliver value — the $ will follow.

3️⃣ Invest in your team over everything.

• As leaders — we work for our team — not the other way around.

I’d shake hands, pass out cards, follow up the next day like clockwork.

But in 2017, I realized something:

Attending events is great.

But hosting them?

That’s a whole different level.

Because when you're the one bringing people together, everything changes.

You're not just meeting people — you’re curating the room.

You're not just attending the event — you are the event.

That first one we hosted?

It was about Facebook Messenger bots (very 2017, I know) — and we packed the room with exactly the kind of growth teams we wanted as clients.

Did every person turn into a sale?

Of course not.

But we weren’t chasing anymore.

We were attracting the right people — and building trust before the first email ever got sent.

If you’re looking for new business — especially in B2B or agency sales — here’s my advice:

Still go to events.

But don’t stop there.

-> Host one.

Own the room.

And build something people actually want to show up for.

💰 Our Goal? $10M ARR!!!

(as a bootstrapped startup!)

Here’s the game plan:

Since 2015, we’ve scaled startups with #PaidAds.

In 2022, we launched our UGC Video Bundles.

We’ve had over 900 companies sign-up.

Recently—we discovered a new customer:

📈 Advertising & Performance Agencies.

(just like us)

1️⃣ Agencies need UGC videos to sell
2️⃣ Our software makes this very easy
3️⃣ So we white-labeled it

Now Agencies can sell UGC Videos

(with actors instead of influencers).

They do it under their own name.

CoEfficient Labs makes the videos (behind-the-scenes).

Here’s the math:

100 agencies → 7-10 clients each → $10M ARR.

📱 Stay tuned—we’re documenting our journey.

But most of the job… is saying no.”
Rick Smith, Co-Founder of Crosscut Ventures

Let that sink in 👇

VC looks glamorous from the outside.

Raise a fund. Write checks. Build a portfolio of hot startups.

But according to Rick — that’s not the job.

The job is passing.

Sticking to your strike zone.

Saying no when everything in you wants to say yes.

In our latest episode of Demo Day, Rick broke down the 4 things every great deal needs:
✅ Market
✅ Product
✅ Team
✅ Valuation

Here’s the wild part…

Even if a company is GREAT —

if the entry price is wrong, the investment doesn’t work.

It’s possible to back a unicorn…

and still lose money.

That’s why Rick plays the long game.

And when he misses a winner?

He doesn’t second guess — as long as he followed his process.

Success is a game of resilience.

Every great founder has faced challenges - but kept going.

The answer is simple: never stop.

Here’s what VC’s & Founders shared:

🧠 Kiley Summers - ""You only fail, if you quit.""

🧠 Brett Brewer - ""It’s a competition in generosity.”

🧠 Ashaney - ""Keep watering your idea.""

💪 Resilience isn’t just a mindset.

It’s the difference between success and giving up.

So, get out there. 

Make it happen.

Here are Minnie Ingersoll’s top 2 traits:

1. Distance Traveled
- It’s not about where you went to school -- it’s about how far you’ve come.
- Whether you grew up in a refugee camp or bootstrapped your way through tough times, top VCs look for a founder who’s fought to get where they are.

2. History of Excellence
- This one echoes what Marlon C. Nichols calls “repeat exceptionalism.”
- Top founders show up again and again -- excelling in sports, school, startups, or life.
- Not one time wins. Patterns of performance.

In this clip from our latest episode of Demo Day, we ask Marlon C. Nichols - Managing Partner at MaC Venture Capital - the question every early-stage founder faces:

👉 Do I quit my job to build this idea? Or raise money first, then build?

Marlon’s answer is honest, practical, and rooted in the reality of venture:

You don’t get taken seriously until you’ve shown you can build something.

Even a small instance of your idea is better than a pitch deck.

Whether you're debating your next move or helping others figure out theirs, this is advice worth hearing.

On May 28–30, we will be hitting the ground at #SubSummit 2025 — not just as attendees, but as an official social video team for the conference.

I’ll be rolling with:

📹 Joel DeVries – our ace videographer (and my best friend)

🧠 Ethan Harm – our content strategist who built the entire content game plan

(Not pictured but deeply critical):

🤝 David Courtemarche – my right-hand guy at conferences and the king of first impressions

👨‍💻 Ryan Clancy – our remote editor, grinding through the night so we can post daily content

Together, we’ve spent the past few weeks building a content strategy that delivers real-time interviews, daily social clips, recap reels, and testimonial videos for both CoEfficient Labs and SubSummit.

💡 We’ve learned a lot from previous conferences:

- Post content ASAP after filming
- Selfies and thank you videos unlock real relationships
- Testimonial content is gold for event organizers
- And if you're gonna stand out... bring something rare (wait until you see our custom coins!!)

This trip isn’t just about content. It’s about impact:

✅ We’re aiming to meet 400 people
✅ Drive 30 creative briefs
✅ Win 6 new clients
✅ And help SubSummit tell the story of their community

We’ve never been to SubSummit. We’ve never been to Dallas.

And we’ve never been more ready.

Let’s go!!

What is the CoEfficient Labs Mobile you ask?

Well...let me tell you a story!

Since Year 1 of TechWeek -- our team has been running around the city to Spotlight as many events as we possibly can.  

We always try and capture ""The Vibe"" -- get shots of people enjoying themselves, sponsors and logos, we mic up the panelists and get cinema quality footage of every event we attend.  

Our goal is to Spotlight the best events for Tech Week for anyone that's not able to make it, AND for the people that did make it and want a fun piece of content to remember it by -- we got you covered!

One of the hardest aspects of covering Tech Week (and events in general) is editing the footage into a shareable piece of content.

There's just so much happening, and getting the footage back to our editing team to dissect can be one of the biggest time sucks.

So.....

This year -- we brought our editors with us!

Zubin Vidor (our fearless editing lead) offered to convert his Van into a real life editing studio with our other editor Ethan Harm.

The two of them have been putting in 10+ hour days, working out of their Van! 

As someone that loves startups, the hustle, and generally ""just going for it""... I could not possibly be more proud and thankful of these two.

We've had so many people ask if we were running a CIA operation outside the events, but in reality, we're just editing content and making shit happen.

To everyone that has stopped by for an interview, or said ""what's up"" to the CoEfficient Labs team -- we love you guys!

Stay tuned....we got lots more videos coming over the next week.

I'm Sean Goldfaden.

Here’s what top founders and VC’s said:

What does it take to secure funding?

🧠 David B. - ""How are you solving the problem?""

🧠 Petra Griffith - ""What’s your unique angle?""

🧠 Michael Silton - ""How capital efficient are you?""

Funding isn’t just about getting a check.

It’s about finding the right connections.

Look for investors who:

1️⃣ Have been in your seat (Anuj Bhalla)

2️⃣ You enjoy working with (Taylor Rothchild)

It’s important to trust the people you work with.

Trust builds speed.

Startups need speed to learn fast, fail fast.

🧠 It all comes down to one thing: an eye-catching hook.

Here are 3 types of video hooks we use at CoEfficient Labs to keep viewers engaged and drive conversions:

Comment Response
– Leverage real questions from your audience to create a natural, curiosity-driven hook.

Tutorials
– Feature a creator on the top half of the screen while demonstrating a product in the bottom half.
- Viewers stay visually engaged while educating them on the product’s value.

Conversation
– Seeing someone interact with themselves instantly catches attention because it’s unexpected.

The key to a successful ad?

Be eye-catching, entertaining, and deliver value. (Bonus points if you do all three 😉)

you might be throwing your money away.

A way that keeps more money in your pocket and delivers content that actually moves the needle.

Paid acquisition had always been our foundation...

But we started experimenting with something new: UGC video bundles.

At the time, #UGC was a small part of what we offered.

→ But the more we leaned in, the more it took off.

Today -- UGC bundles are what we’re best known for.

That shift didn’t happen overnight.

It wasn’t even our original intention.

It came from listening to our clients.

They told us what was working.

They told us what they wanted more of.

And we adjusted.

That’s why this clip with Jeff Bocan of Okapi Venture Capital hit home.

Jeff’s advice: Start with conviction - but hold it lightly.

Because the business you think you’re building…

Might just lead you to something bigger.

The best companies stay flexible.

They listen.

They evolve.

Not with a complete pivot —

But with a slight turn in the right direction.

“The things that make the biggest difference in your business will not be in your business plan.”

And that’s exactly what happened with CoEfficient Labs.

We started with a clear mission—

📈 To scale venture-backed startups with paid ads.

But a few years ago, something unexpected happened:

Amid our growth — we found a certain type of creative working much better than every other type of ad we launched.

🚀 UGC videos.

At first, we started making them to help our clients.

But as it turns out, UGC wasn’t just a pivot—it was a game changer.

Fast forward to today and our UGC Video Bundles have turned CoEfficient Labs into a multi-million dollar company.

The lesson?

Stay open to the unexpected.

💡 The opportunities you never planned for might be the ones that change everything.

🤔 What’s the opportunity that changed your life?

Back in 2016, I’d walk past Upfront Ventures every morning.

I would say to my teammate Joel…

“Dude! How incredible would it be to work with Mark Suster someday!?”

Year after year would go by…

and one day…

I had the opportunity to meet the one-and-only Kerry Bennett!

We had coffee at a hole-in-the-wall spot outside on the patio - and I immediately knew we clicked.

Our personalities are quite different (certainly our reading taste) - but our love for startups, marketing, and helping founders succeed was almost identical.

Kerry has been a steady beat to the drum of the CoEfficient Labs journey.

In 2020 (weeks before lockdown during COVID) - Kerry gave us a chance to help out with the #UpfrontSummit video.

To this day that project is still one of my favorite memories at CoEfficient Labs - a story for another day.

But fast forward to last night at #UpfrontSummit2025…

My 2016-self would be absolutely freaking out!

Kerry & Mark (and the entire squad behind the LA Tech Community Cares Fund) wanted to find a way to drive more donations for the victims of the LA Wildfires in January.

With the help of dozens of startups & venture capitalists - CoEfficient Labs helped create a fundraising video that raised over $130,000 over the last 2 days!

It was so cool to play a small part in such a big success for the community.

But hearing Mark Suster & Kerry Bennett give CoEfficient Labs a LIVE shoutout in front of the ENTIRE #UpfrontSummit was a moment I’ll NEVER forget.

In fact — I called my mom right after!

”Mom! You’re never going to believe what just happened!”

It was so cool.

Huge thank you to the entire Upfront Ventures team for trusting us (and for throwing one of the best events of the year).

I really love you guys!

The Lesson:

Put your dreams out there to the world.

Then go out there and make it happen! 🔥

There’s only one trait of their top 1% founders.

You’ll never guess it 👇🏻

-it’s not being a repeat CEO

-has nothing to do with age

-and every #VC I’ve told this to. 100% agrees.

In our latest clip from Demo Day, TX Zhuo (Managing Partner at Fika Ventures) shares the surprising result of an internal study that reshaped how they evaluate founders.

That one trait 👉🏻 speed of responsiveness.

Is it possible to be a successful company without their founder (and team) being fast to respond?

Of course.

But when Fika ran the #’s (and they had dozens of signals to measure against)…

This was the trait (and only pattern) they found amongst their top 1% investments.

And while this is certainly up for debate…

Think about your interactions in business with different people.

Some people take days, weeks, or even never respond.

They “think” it’s not that big of a deal.

Or maybe they don’t think about it at all —

They’re “so busy”, “so overwhelmed with keeping their company afloat”, or “so focused…”

Whatever the reason — VC’s notice.

Customers notice.

Your Team notices.

I wish I didn’t fall into this bucket.

But sometimes I do.

And when TX mentioned it — it was like a gut punch because intuitively — I get it!

When I send someone an email (especially a candidate I’m looking to hire) — the difference between someone that responds almost immediately or within minutes or an hour of me pinging them vs someone who responds after 2-3 days is palpable.

It’s rare that I think “ohhh, this person doesn’t care.”

But when I get that fast response — I think “ohh, this person DEFINITELY CARES!

So — this is your reminder — and my reminder — that responsiveness matters.

We may not think it matters.

But it does.

👍 “LIKE” if you agree.

♻️ ”REPOST” to remind a friend

🎤 Comment if you disagree & post the trait you look for!

Great companies aren’t built alone. 

They’re built with the right partners—on your team and your cap table.

✅ Who sees what you can’t?
✅ Who opens doors you can’t reach?
✅ Who pushes your thinking, not just nods along?

The best VCs don’t just write checks.

They bring value you can’t hire for.

They disappear for 3 years… then suddenly ask for help.

Sure — you might technically be able to pick up where you left off…

But the relationship won’t be as strong. And the ask won’t land the same.

That’s why, as Jeff Bocan puts it, ""frequency really matters.”

Every time he gets great news, he forwards it to his investors with a quick personal note.

Sometimes it sparks a convo.

Sometimes it’s just a small touchpoint.

Sometimes… it’s a text about the Eagles winning the Super Bowl.

But those little moments?

They compound.

They’re what keep relationships warm in the long game of venture — where capital return can take 7, 10, even 12 years.

And sure — Jeff admits he could probably be more deliberate.

But even the serendipitous moments matter:

- ""Oh I’m in their city — I should text them.”

- ""I haven’t talked to this person in a while — I should reach out.”

It’s less about perfect planning.

And more about never letting the thread go cold.

Because at the end of the day…

Founders who keep in touch are the ones that investors remember — and the ones they bet on again.

👇 What’s your best way to keep relationships warm?

On this week’s episode of Demo Day, Marlon C. Nichols (Managing Partner at MaC Venture Capital) shared how VCs evaluate founders in a world that moves fast and changes faster.

“You don’t hire a jockey if there’s no horse.”

But the inverse is just as true.

Because the market will shift. Products will pivot. Roadmaps will rewrite themselves.

And when they do, VCs need to believe the founder can adapt, rebuild—and still find a path to a billion-dollar outcome.

💡 It's not about having all the answers.

It's about proving you're the kind of founder who can find them.

But what TX Zhuo (Managing Partner at Fika Ventures) learned was the exact opposite👇

Some of the most seasoned investors he met—founders who exited for $500M, operators from Google—weren’t afraid to say:

""That’s out of my scope. I don’t know.”

And that was the moment it clicked.

Because honesty isn’t a weakness in venture.

It’s a strength.

It’s how founders learn to trust you.

It’s how you avoid overstepping.

And it’s how you build a cap table full of partners—not passengers.
