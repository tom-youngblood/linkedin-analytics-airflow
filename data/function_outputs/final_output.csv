If you want to get better, blame yourself.” 
– Alex Hormozi

This clip hit me hard — because it aligns perfectly with one of my favorite leadership books of all time: Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

🛑 Victim mindset kills performance

🛠 Ownership mindset builds teams that win

When something breaks down in our agency —

I don’t ask “who messed up?”

I ask:
→ “What could I have done better?”
→ “Where did I drop the ball as a leader?”

Extreme Ownership dedicates an entire chapter to this:

There are no bad teams. Only bad leaders.

Bad leaders deflect.

Great leaders absorb.

They turn every failure into feedback.

At CoEfficient Labs, this isn’t just a leadership book on a shelf.

It’s baked into our culture — from growth hackers to video editors to software engineers.

We don’t point fingers.

We point inward.

Because when the leadership takes ownership…

the whole team starts rowing in the same direction.

🎧 Watch the full video (it’s only 60 seconds) — it might change how you lead this week.

📚 Shoutout to Alex Hormozi, Jocko Willink, & Leif Babin — your work shaped how I lead today.

But most of the job… is saying no.”
Rick Smith, Co-Founder of Crosscut Ventures

Let that sink in 👇

VC looks glamorous from the outside.

Raise a fund. Write checks. Build a portfolio of hot startups.

But according to Rick — that’s not the job.

The job is passing.

Sticking to your strike zone.

Saying no when everything in you wants to say yes.

In our latest episode of Demo Day, Rick broke down the 4 things every great deal needs:
✅ Market
✅ Product
✅ Team
✅ Valuation

Here’s the wild part…

Even if a company is GREAT —

if the entry price is wrong, the investment doesn’t work.

It’s possible to back a unicorn…

and still lose money.

That’s why Rick plays the long game.

And when he misses a winner?

He doesn’t second guess — as long as he followed his process.

and left with leads.
At Loyola Marymount University’s career expo, we had one goal:

→ Meet great talent.

But what we didn’t expect?

The real value wasn’t just in the students…

It was in the other tables:
- Recruiters
- Sales leaders
- Executives

All from companies we could actually help.

So we did what we always do:
- Talked to everyone
- Got the emails
- Shared what makes us different

No fancy booth.

No hard sell.

Just authentic connection.

Because whether it’s a job fair, a lunch meeting, or a yoga studio (yep, met someone from YogaWorks)...

→ It’s all a stage if you treat it like one.

If you want new business, new intros, new growth—

You can’t wait for the “right moment.”

You need to make the moment.

And inevitably, some of those passes become massive wins.
Here are the 3 questions Rick Smith asks himself when a pass wins big:

1. Did we even see the deal?
- If not, why not? Was it in our network? In our market? That’s a sourcing gap.

2. Was it in our strike zone?
- Right stage, right sector, right founder? If not, maybe it just wasn’t a fit.

3. Did we follow our process?
- If yes, then even a miss is a win. Because consistency > regret.

💡 The takeaway: Don’t obsess over what you didn’t do.

Obsess over having a repeatable process — and sticking to it.

You need to hear what Rick Smith shared 👇🏻

In one of our most honest convos yet, Rick walks through the real challenges of being a first-time VC — and how to survive long enough to raise Fund II.

Highlights from the episode:
- How Crosscut Ventures almost didn’t make it
- Why Fund II is the hardest to raise (and what gets you there)
- The mindset shift that made Rick a better investor
- What most junior VCs get wrong about breaking into the industry
- Why “swinging bigger” is the only path forward

Whether you're raising a fund, building a startup, or dreaming of doing both — this episode is required listening.
